# Flappybird
Idea:

Use the Pygame library to create a graphical user interface for the game

Use the PyTorch library for the artificial intelligence components of the game

Steps:

Set up your development environment with Pygame and PyTorch installed

Create a basic window for the game using Pygame

Create a bird sprite and add it to the game window

Add pipes to the game window that the bird must avoid

Implement gravity for the bird so it falls when not flying

Add code to detect collisions between the bird and the pipes

Implement a scoring system based on how many pipes the bird has passed

Train a neural network using PyTorch to play the game

Connect the neural network to the game so that it can control the bird's movement

Add a game over screen and logic for restarting the game after a loss
